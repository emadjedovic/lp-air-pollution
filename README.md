# Operations Research Project

This operations research project focuses on the development of a linear program with the aim of minimizing air pollution in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while simultaneously optimizing costs and taking into account the social aspect. Through precisely defined decision variables, the objective function, and constraints, the research covers a wide spectrum of factors in the energy sector.

## Key Components

- **Decision Variables:** Quantity of different energy sources, number of installed alternative energy sources, and the number of employees at various production and installation facilities.
- **Objective Function:** Aims to minimize pollution, costs, and the number of employees, considering the prices of energy sources, installations, and maintenance, and emphasizing social responsibility.
- **Limitations:** Encompass parameters such as the availability of energy sources, production of thermal energy, restrictions on the installation of alternative sources, budget constraints, and conditions for the number of employees.
